Write Grafana dashboards in Python + download and customize all existing dashboards

## Why?

I have been enjoying [grafanalib](https://github.com/weaveworks/grafanalib) in my system. However, I also want to use (download and customize) the dashboards (https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/) created by other people - which does not seem to be very easy with grafanalib. Therefore, I create this tiny utility.
